# Drowsiness-Detection
Aims to improve road safety by monitoring drivers in real time. Using computer vision and machine learning techniques, the system analyzes facial features and eye movements to detect signs of fatigue. When drowsiness is detected, it triggers alerts to prevent accidents, providing a proactive safety solution for driver.
